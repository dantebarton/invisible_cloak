# invisible_cloak

This script implements a "Harry Potter-like" invisible cloak effect using 
computer vision techniques. It captures a background frame, then replaces
pixels matching a specific color range with the background, creating an
illusion of invisibility.

## To launch script ##
1. Copy the repository and its contents
2. In a terminal, run "python3 invisible_cloak.py"
3. Avoid being in the frame while the program captures the frame in the first 2 seconds
4. Grab a green cloth and drape it over yourself
5. Watch the magic!!!
